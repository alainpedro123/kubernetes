Kubernetes Fundamentals - Exercises ðŸ’»ðŸš€
===============================

a) Getting started
----
1. What is the version of Kubernetes running on the nodes?

b) PODs with YAML
----
1. Create a new pod with the nginx image.
2. List the all PODs that have been created.
3. What is the image used to create the new pods?
4. Which nodes are these pods placed on?
5. How many containers are part of the pod webapp?
6. What images are used in the new webapp pod?
7. What is the state of the container agentx in the pod webapp?
8. Why do you think the container agentx in pod webapp is in error?
9. What does the READY column in the output of the "kubectl get pods" command indicate?
10. Delete the webapp Pod. Once deleted, wait for the pod to fully terminate.
11. Create a POD using YAML based configuration file below (pod.yml)
```sh
$ vim pod.yml
```
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: nginx
  labels:
    app: nginx
  	tier: frontend
spec:
  containers:
  - name: nginx
    image: nginx
```   

12. Create a new pod with the name redis and with the image redis123. Use a pod-definition YAML file below. (the image name is wrong)
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  creationTimestamp: null
  labels:
    run: redis
  name: redis
spec:
  containers:
  - image: redis123
    name: redis
    resources: {}
  dnsPolicy: ClusterFirst
  restartPolicy: Always
status: {}
```

c) Imperative commands
---
1. Deploy a pod named nginx-pod using the nginx:alpine image.
2. Deploy a redis pod using the redis:alpine image with the labels set to tier=db.
3. Create a service redis-service to expose the redis application within the cluster on port 6379.
* Service: redis-service
* Port: 6379
* Type: ClusterIP

4. Create a deployment named webapp using the image kodekloud/webapp-color with 3 replicas.
5. Create a new pod called custom-nginx using the nginx image and expose it on container port 8080.
6. Create a new namespace called dev-ns.
7. Create a new deployment called redis-deploy in the dev-ns namespace with the redis image. It should have 2 replicas.
8. Create a pod called "httpd" using the image "httpd:alpine" in the default namespace. Next, create a service of type "ClusterIP" by the same name (httpd). The target port for the service should be 80.


c) Replication Controller / ReplicaSets
----
1. Create "Replication Controller" using YAML based configuration file (rc-definition.yml)
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ReplicationController
metadata:
  name: myapp-rc
  labels:
  	app: myapp
  	type: frontend

spec:
  template:

  	metadata:
  	  name: myapp-pod
  	  labels:
  	  	app: myapp
  	  	type: front-end
  	spec:
  	  containers:
  	  -  name: nginx-container
  	     image: nginx

  replicas: 3
```

2. How many ReplicaSets exist on the system?
3. How about now? How many ReplicaSets do you see?
4. How many PODs are DESIRED in the new-replica-set?
5. Create "Replica Set" using YAML based configuration file (rc-definition.yml)
```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: ReplicationSet
metadata:
  name: myapp-replicaset
  labels:
  	app: myapp
  	type: frontend

spec:
  template:

  	metadata:
  	  name: myapp-pod
  	  labels:
  	  	app: myapp
  	  	type: front-end
  	spec:
  	  containers:
  	  -  name: nginx-container
  	     image: nginx

  replicas: 3
  selector:
  	matchLabels:
  		type: front-end
```

6. Update the replica to scale from 3 to 6
7. What is the image used to create the pods in the new-replica-set?
8. How many PODs are READY in the new-replica-set?
9. Why "new-replica-set" is not on READY status?
10. Delete any of the 4 existing PODs
11. How many PODS exist now?
12. Why are there still 4 PODs, even after you deleted one?
13. Create a ReplicaSet using the replicaset-definition-1.yaml file located at /root/. There is an issue with the file, so try to fix it.
14. Create a ReplicaSet using the replicaset-definition-2.yaml file located at /root/. There is an issue with the file, so try to fix it.
15. Delete the two newly created ReplicaSets - replicaset-1 and replicaset-2
16. Fix the original replica set new-replica-set to use the correct busybox image. Either delete and recreate the ReplicaSet or Update the existing ReplicaSet and then delete all PODs, so new ones with the correct image will be created.

17. Scale the ReplicaSet to 5 PODs. Use kubectl scale command or edit the replicaset using kubectl edit replicaset.
18. Now scale the ReplicaSet down to 2 PODs.
